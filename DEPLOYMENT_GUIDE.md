# BBSchedule Production Deployment Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for deploying BBSchedule (Construction Project Scheduler) to production environments with enterprise-grade security, performance, and monitoring.

## üöÄ Quick Deployment on Replit

### 1. Environment Setup

The application is already configured for Replit deployment. Required environment variables:

```bash
# Database (provided by Replit)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...

# Security (required)
SESSION_SECRET=your-super-secret-key-here

# Optional Configuration
FLASK_ENV=production
LOG_LEVEL=WARNING
```

### 2. Deploy Now

1. Click the **Deploy** button in your Replit interface
2. BBSchedule will automatically be available at your Replit deployment URL
3. Monitor deployment status through Replit's deployment console

### 3. Post-Deployment Verification

Visit these endpoints to verify deployment:
- `/health/ping` - Basic health check
- `/health/ready` - Readiness check
- `/health/status` - Comprehensive status

## üèó Advanced Production Setup

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Core Configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/dbname
SESSION_SECRET=generate-a-strong-secret-key

# Security Settings
FLASK_ENV=production
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True
SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY=True

# Performance Settings
SQLALCHEMY_POOL_SIZE=20
SQLALCHEMY_MAX_OVERFLOW=30
SQLALCHEMY_POOL_TIMEOUT=30

# File Upload Settings
UPLOAD_FOLDER=/app/uploads
MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH=16777216  # 16MB

# Monitoring
LOG_LEVEL=WARNING
LOG_FILE=/app/logs/app.log
```

### Database Optimization

Run the database optimization script:

```python
python database_optimization.py
```

This will:
- Create production indexes for optimal query performance
- Optimize PostgreSQL settings
- Clean up old data
- Generate performance statistics

### Security Hardening

The application includes comprehensive security features:

**Implemented Security Features:**
- ‚úÖ Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting on API endpoints
- ‚úÖ Input validation and sanitization
- ‚úÖ SQL injection protection
- ‚úÖ CSRF protection
- ‚úÖ Secure session management
- ‚úÖ File upload validation

**Additional Security Recommendations:**
- Use HTTPS in production (handled by Replit Deployments)
- Implement authentication (currently session-based)
- Set up API keys for external integrations
- Configure firewall rules
- Enable audit logging

### Monitoring and Alerting

**Built-in Monitoring:**
- Health check endpoints at `/health/*`
- Application metrics at `/api/monitoring/metrics`
- Alert system at `/api/monitoring/alerts`
- Performance tracking and logging

**Key Metrics Tracked:**
- Database response time and connection pool usage
- Memory and CPU utilization
- Request response times
- Error rates and types
- Business metrics (projects, activities, completion rates)

**Alerting Thresholds:**
- Database response time > 500ms
- Memory usage > 80%
- Disk usage > 85%
- Connection pool usage > 80%
- Overdue activities > 10

### Performance Optimization

**Database Performance:**
- Connection pooling with 20 base connections
- Query optimization with strategic indexes
- Automatic query plan analysis
- Data cleanup routines

**Application Performance:**
- Gzip compression for static assets
- Efficient SQLAlchemy queries
- Background processing for long-running tasks
- Caching for frequently accessed data

## üìä Production Monitoring

### Health Checks

Configure your load balancer/monitoring tools to check:

```bash
# Liveness probe
GET /health/live

# Readiness probe  
GET /health/ready

# Detailed status
GET /health/status
```

### Metrics Collection

Collect metrics from:

```bash
# Application metrics
GET /api/monitoring/metrics

# Active alerts
GET /api/monitoring/alerts

# 24-hour summary
GET /api/monitoring/summary
```

### Log Analysis

Application logs include:
- Request tracing with unique request IDs
- Performance metrics with execution times
- Security events and alerts
- Error details with stack traces
- User activity auditing

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Database Connection Issues:**
```bash
# Check database connectivity
curl https://your-app.replit.app/health/ready

# Check database metrics
curl https://your-app.replit.app/api/monitoring/metrics
```

**Performance Issues:**
- Monitor `/api/monitoring/metrics` for response times
- Check database connection pool usage
- Review error logs for bottlenecks
- Run database optimization script

**Memory Issues:**
- Monitor system metrics via health endpoints
- Check for memory leaks in application logs
- Consider scaling up resources

### Debug Mode

For debugging in production (use carefully):

```bash
# Enable debug logging
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

# Access detailed error information
GET /health/status
```

## üìà Scaling Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling

**Load Balancing:**
- Multiple application instances
- Database read replicas
- Session storage in Redis
- File storage in cloud storage

**Auto-scaling Triggers:**
- CPU usage > 70%
- Memory usage > 80%
- Response time > 1000ms
- Queue length > 100

### Database Scaling

**Optimization Strategies:**
- Read replicas for reporting
- Connection pooling optimization
- Query optimization and indexing
- Data archiving strategies
